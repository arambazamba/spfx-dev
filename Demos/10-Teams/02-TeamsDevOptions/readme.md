# Getting Started

[Get started with Microsoft Teams app development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/build-your-first-app/build-first-app-overview#get-prerequisites)

[Build apps with the Teams Toolkit and Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview)

Three scaffolding options:

-   `generator-teams@2.17.1` creates a class based structure that corresponds to the lab guides.
-   The current generator (V3.x) creates a React Hooks based structure. Read [more](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/announcing-microsoft-teams-app-generator-yo-teams-version-3/)
-   Teams toolkit also creates a different structure
